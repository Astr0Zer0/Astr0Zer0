# :wave:Howdy there,:wave:

I'm a 2nd year student pursuing a graduation in **Computer Science and Engineering** from **Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra**. I have an insatiable thirst for knowledge, and my curiosity for how things work and techonology ends up making every day an adventure.

I really enjoy Artificial Intelligence, and desktop app programming. Python and C are my favorite languages. Apart from that I also love to teach and guide newbies in starting programming. I'm currently into OOP and working on my data-structures and algorithms skills.
